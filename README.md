a discord bot for multiple purposes.

distribution.py is the main file.

if you don't download some text files, you need to make them.(sorry for lazy work)

you have to edit distribution.py for write osu api and discord token.

this bot is not public bot. if you need to join DPSBot to your server, and don't want to run this on your PC, please contact me via discord.
